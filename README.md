# Calorie Logger

**Short Story:**
	I had gained enough programming knowledge to make simple programs to improve life a bit. Again, I wanted a bare-bones, focused experience.
	
**Long Story:**
	When I started working on this I had no idea loggers were a class of program. I defined my problem and implemented a solution. I wanted to finish as soon as possible to start using the program. Combined with my experience level at the time the design is certainly on the rare side of cooked.
